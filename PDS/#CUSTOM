Customising display panels
--------------------------
   To make this work without the need for running the library
   allocation exec which is part of the demonstrations, you should
   install the various components in the appropriate ISPF libraries

   Anything            should go
   starting:           to:

   UTC                 SYSPROC or SYSEXEC
   UTP                 ISPPLIB


   To set up a table display panel, change either PFANDF3 or
   UTPVL01.

    1) change the row starting %cmd to have your headings
    2) change the row starting !lcmd to have your variables.
    3) change between the comment

                             /* SORT command                 ...start */

       and the corresponding ...end

       - change so that the column names you've coded under 1) match
         the sort options
       - change so that the variables you've coded under 2) match
         your table variables

    4) If you don't want to have Browse and Update exits, delete
       the lines from
                             /* Exits for browse and update  ...start */
                 to
                             /* Exits for browse and update  ...end   */

    5) If you don't have an exit, you will need a panel for updating
       a single row. Clone UPTVL02 for this purpose. You should only
       need to change the )BODY part of the panel.

    6) Read the #INVOKE member to see how to invoke the UTCTSHAR
       exec. The two panels you've just created will be the
       TBPAN and FULLPAN parameters.
